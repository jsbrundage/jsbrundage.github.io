                    The dead are walking. And they remember where they need to go.
                    <br><br>
                    Kira Duskwalker is a ranger—a tracker, a messenger, a woman who's spent years learning to handle
                    trouble on her own. But when the dead start clawing out of the mountains, she realizes some trouble
                    is too big for one person. Four strangers. No reason to trust each other. Every reason to walk away.
                    But something ancient is waking beneath the mountains—something that's been imprisoned for five
                    hundred years.

                    When a desperate mission sends Kira, Helga, Finn, and Alaric deep into Mistral Marsh, they discover
                    the treacherous swamp holds more than quicksand and hungry predators. Something ancient stirs
                    beneath the black water—something that was meant to stay forgotten. With Helga's courage tested,
                    Finn's past catching up to them, and Alaric's faith shaken, Kira must hold her found family
                    together.

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
            J.S. Brundage built the Thornwick Protectorate for his sons. As a Dungeon Master, he'd spent years drawing
            maps, voicing NPCs, and setting traps. But there's the thing about being the DM: you never get to be
            surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
            He wanted to play too.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a rainy weekend when his youngest and he were both home sick with the flu, he decided to try something
            different—could AI run a decent D&D session? He wrote a prompt, set the scene in a corner of the
            Protectorate he'd never fully explored, and started rolling dice.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happened surprised him. The AI didn't just run combat—it told a story. Characters emerged with real
            voices. Tensions built. For the first time, he got to experience his own world without knowing what came
            next.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Duskwalker Chronicles is a gift for his boys, born from a flu-weekend experiment. Welcome to the
            Thornwick Protectorate.
